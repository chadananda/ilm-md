## Example of non-closing underline

 'They will say that the servant of Bahá'u'lláh [pg7] has brought and consumed the good and supplies of the storekeepers without paying for them. Unless I pay all these obligations, I cannot go. But if they take me, never mind. If they punish me, there is no harm in that. If they kill me, do not be grieved. But to go away is impossible. I must remain until I pay all I owe. Then I will go.' For one month Isfandiyár went about in the streets and bazaars. He had things to sell, and from his earnings he gradually paid his creditors. In fact, they were not his debts but the debts of the court, for all our properties had been confiscated. Everything we had was taken away from us. The only things that remained were our debts. Isfandiyár paid them in full; not a single penny remained unpaid. Then he came to us, said good-bye and went away. Afterward Bahá'u'lláh was released from prison. We went to Baghdad, and Isfandiyár came there. He wanted to stay in the same home. Bahá'u'lláh, the Blessed Perfection, said to him, 'When you fled away, there was a Persian minister who gave shelter at a time when no one else could give you protection. Because he gave you shelter and protected you, shelter at a time when no one else could give you protection. Because he gave you shelter and protected you, you must be faithful to him. If the is satisfied to have you go, then come to us; but if he does not want you to go, do not leave him.' His master said, 'I do not want to be separated from Isfandiyár. Where can I find another like him, with such sincerity, such faithfulness, such character, such power? Where can I find one? On Isfandiyár! I am not according to your own will.' But because the Blessed Perfection had said, 'You must be faithful,' Isfandiyár stayed with his master until he died. He was a point of light. Although his colour was black, yet his character was luminous; his mind was luminous; his face was luminous. Truly, he was a point of light. 

## Example of dropping paragraphs 

Stories have always been important as means of illustrating principle, improving retention in learning and providing a way to meaningfully engage people of all ages. For Bahá'ís, what could be more helpful than a collection of stories told by 'Abdu'l-Bahá to illustrate the many points He wished to highlight in various talks and Tablets? 

This unique collection of stories related by the beloved Master in the course of His talks and correspondence is a first in the English-speaking world and provides a welcome addition to current  Bahá'í literature. Ranging from light and humorous to serious and philosophical, the stories are bound to educate and delight the reader. 

Not only do they have an intrinsic value for the sheer joy of reading pleasure, the stories serve as an important and welcome addition to the materials needed for the growing numbers of people who are engaged in developing classes for all ages, as well as greatly enhancing the pool of source materials for an ever-expanding number of artistic pursuits. This volume will surely become a favourite for all ages!

## Example of problem starting line with 'Abdu'l-Bahá

Many of the stories have been translated from their original Personal into English by the compiler. A good number of them were already translated by the early Persian Bahá'ís who came to the United States. Where such translations have been published,[pg10] as in _Stars of the West_ or _The Promulgation of the Universal Peace,_ these translations have been used in the present volume.

'Abdu'l-Bahá liked to tell and to hear stories. While He was in the United States, a luncheon party was given in His honour by Mrs Agnes Parsons in Dublin, New Hampshire. In _Portals to Freedom_ Howard Colby Ives writes,

Also, we sometimes have italicized persian words like _K_hanum's Life and Adventures_ -- which is tough.
