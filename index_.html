## Example of non-closing underline

Facing the house of Abdul Baha in Adrianople, there was a café. Here every day sat a retired officer of the Turkish Army belonging to the Baktashi's sect. The Baktashis are always on good terms with the Bahais. They are peaceful people. This retired soldier received a pension of 5 Piasters (25¢) a day from the government. Every morning he would come and take a chair in front of the café and order a cup of coffee. Then the people would gather around him and listen with delight and laughter to his stories until noon. At that hour he would call the waiter and given him five cents to buy him two loaves of bread, two rolls of roast-meat and a dish of salad. The he would ask for a clean table and use his neat handkerchief as a tablecloth. Every day he invited one of the habitués of the café to lunch with him. 'Come here, my friend!' he would say, placing a chair on the other side of the table, and leaving before it a loaf of bread [pg2] and one of the roast-meats. 'Come and be my guest today.' Then he would commence to eat. Every mouthful that was taken was followed by a short sentence. 'Oh God! I thank Thee! How delicious is this lunch!' - till it was finished. Then again he would start his conversation, always tempered with sharp wit and the joy of living. From time to time he would come to the Mosque of Sultan Suleiman [Sulaymán] where the Governor and the officers would gather about him to pass a pleasant hour. He would keep them roaring with laughter over his stories. One day... the Baktashi entered with a mat under his arm. Laughingly he saluted everyone and said: "Today I am going to start on a long journey; therefore, I beg you all to forgive all my past shortcomings!' 'Art thou going to Baghdad?' one asked. 'Further! much further!' 'Surely to China?' 'Very much further.' 'Then no doubt to Australia?' 'Still further.' All this time everybody laughed because they thought he had a joke up his sleeve. 'Please, please,' he pleaded, 'I beg you to forgive me. Say that you do!'

## Example of dropping paragraphs 

Stories have always been important as means of illustrating principle, improving retention in learning and providing a way to meaningfully engage people of all ages. For Bahá'ís, what could be more helpful than a collection of stories told by 'Abdu'l-Bahá to illustrate the many points He wished to highlight in various talks and Tablets? 

This unique collection of stories related by the beloved Master in the course of His talks and correspondence is a first in the English-speaking world and provides a welcome addition to current  Bahá'í literature. Ranging from light and humorous to serious and philosophical, the stories are bound to educate and delight the reader. 

Not only do they have an intrinsic value for the sheer joy of reading pleasure, the stories serve as an important and welcome addition to the materials needed for the growing numbers of people who are engaged in developing classes for all ages, as well as greatly enhancing the pool of source materials for an ever-expanding number of artistic pursuits. This volume will surely become a favourite for all ages!

## Example of problem starting line with 'Abdu'l-Bahá

Many of the stories have been translated from their original Personal into English by the compiler. A good number of them were already translated by the early Persian Bahá'ís who came to the United States. Where such translations have been published,[pg10] as in _Stars of the West_ or _The Promulgation of the Universal Peace,_ these translations have been used in the present volume.

'Abdu'l-Bahá liked to tell and to hear stories. While He was in the United States, a luncheon party was given in His honour by Mrs Agnes Parsons in Dublin, New Hampshire. In _Portals to Freedom_ Howard Colby Ives writes,

Also, we sometimes have italicized persian words like _K_hanum's Life and Adventures_ -- which is tough.
